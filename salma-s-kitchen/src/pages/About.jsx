      <p id="salma"> 
        Hey there, and welcome to Salma's Kitchen! As you might have guessed
        from the title, my name is Salma! I’m a 20-year-old computer science
        student with a deep passion for cooking and baking. Over the years, this
        art has grown to become my favorite hobby.
      </p>
      <p id="salma">
        I began learning to cook at a very young age. As a child, I would join
        my mother in the kitchen, mesmerized as I watched her create magic with
        her recipes. Slowly but surely, I started helping her, and by the age of
        12, I found myself cooking for a group of 12 people—a challenge that
        sparked my confidence and love for the culinary arts.
      </p>
      <p id="salma">
        Today, I can proudly say that I’m capable of cooking a wide variety of
        dishes. Of course, practice makes perfect, and while I may not
        flawlessly master every recipe out there, I can confidently assure you
        that every recipe shared on this page has been thoroughly tested and
        cooked multiple times before being posted.
      </p>
      <p id="salma">
        This website marks the beginning of my journey to share my love for food
        with all of you. Oh, and because I’m a computer science student, I also
        designed this website myself—combining my two passions, tech and
        cooking, into one platform!
